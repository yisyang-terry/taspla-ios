# Product Brief

## Problem
People struggle to convert life values into actionable goals, and then to sustain progress via consistent execution.

## Solution
An iOS app that:
- Anchors goals to primary life values
- Breaks goals into epics and tasks
- Schedules tasks and auto-generates calendar events
- Provides views to plan (backlog, composer), execute (kanban), and reflect (calendar)
- Offers an optional LLM copilot to draft goals/epics/tasks from plain language

## Users
- Individuals optimizing personal growth and routines
- Knowledge workers managing mid- to long-term outcomes

## Differentiators
- Value-first hierarchy (Values → Goals → Epics → Tasks)
- Lightweight scheduling with auto-generated events
- Clean, opinionated POC UI to validate workflow quickly

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- Time-to-first-scheduled-task (< 5 minutes)
- Weekly active users returning to Kanban and Calendar
- Task completion rate and streak adherence

## Risks / Mitigations
- Over-complexity → Keep MVP scope tight, defer integrations
- Calendar edge cases → Start with simple daily/weekly/monthly recurrence
- LLM hallucinations → Keep LLM suggestions opt-in and editable
